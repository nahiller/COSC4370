For HW3 I used online resources to help me with the assignment. I used artciles on learnOpenGL because I was having lots of issues getting my 
code to produce what was in the assignment directions. Credit towards the resources I used, I want to avoid plagerism so that is why
I linked them in my source code at the top and I included them in the written report as well. This is my last place to make sure that 
I'm covered. Thank you
